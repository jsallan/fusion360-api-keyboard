A keyboard generator based on the Fusion 360 python API

## Tips for using the Fusion360 API
I found the online documentation to be annoying to navigate and difficult to find what I needed. So here a some tips to discover great new methods.
- Use the debugger. This is a great way to traverse the API.
- While in the debugger, try e.g. ```help(component.features)``` to see the documentation for something specific.
- Once you have a specific method or something that you want to use, I've found decent help on the [autodesk forums](https://forums.autodesk.com).
